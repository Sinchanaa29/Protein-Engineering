The collaboration between artificial intelligence (AI) and protein engineering has significantly
accelerated genomic research with the potential to precisely predict mutation effects. However,
there is a great threat to genomic information acquisition with the advent of quantum computing,
which undermines traditional encryption techniques. In this work, we introduce an optimised
hybrid post-quantum cryptography (PQC) scheme that achieves a balance between security and
computational efficiency for AI-aided mutation analysis. The encryption process was carried on
two main factors – Relative Solvent Accessibility and Hydrogen Bond Energy – using
lattice-based encryption techniques while also preserving the integrity of less sensitive data by
using Differential Privacy so that computational efficiency remains uncompromised. We have
made use of Machine Learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost for classification of
mutations into Beneficial, Neutral and Detrimental categories, achieving 100% efficiency in
controlled setting (resulting in overfitting) and 96.3% efficiency in federated learning
environments (resulting in an almost perfect model). We prefer the hybrid PQC model as it
reduces encryption overhead by 30% as compared to the full PQC model. The conclusion that we
draw from these results demonstrate the efficiency of privacy-preserving AI in protein
engineering for systems requiring high-level quantum adaptable security.
